    "motivations": "I am highly motivated to express the term power to the edges in a way that matters, its not often you are presented with an opportunity to actually make a difference at a global level, this drives me to be better and do better as a human being. The idea that not only can I empower my family directly but can also impact, in most cases people I will never meet, with the ability to have financial freedom, fills my heart with gratitude.",
    "objectives": "Always been a bit off since I was a kid when it comes to follow social norms, asking questions that controlling authorities never seemed to like. Then one day I hear about the Cant be evil philosophy through using Blockchain tech and went directly to, yes Ethereum lol. Worst idea ever as it provided me with the worst experience where smart coders prayed on others, coming into to learn how to empower themselves. Then the youtube algo grabbed me and steered me to Cardano, the rest is history",

    "qualifications": "I have 30 years experience running various business's have had over 30 years of governance experience with a large anonymous group and have a passion for making peoples lives better however I can. Roberts rules of order are something I have used the entire time and at this point it comes quite naturally to me.",
